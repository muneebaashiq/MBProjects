# MBProjects

## Task Given: 
1. Build benchmark Maven and Gradle applications with the Java packages provided.
2. Use the same components for the applicationsâ€™ vulnerable and non-vulnerable parts just with different versions 

## Approach To Task: 
1. First, I found out the components from the data given along with the versions that had vulnerabilities and the ones in which these vulnerabilities had been patched.
2. Although the patched components have their own vulnerabilities, they do not include the vulnerabilities that the unpatched versions include.
3. Then I made 4 separate projects in total.
4. The Maven project was divided into its vulnerable and non-vulnerable parts.
5. The same thing was done for the Gradle projects. 

## Human Analysis: 
The following are a few of the CVEs I expect to be present in the non-vulnerable versions of the projects. 

They are in the form:
